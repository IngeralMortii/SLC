        <p>Elder Gerrit W. Gong of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles speaks during the Saturday evening session of the 194th <br> Semiannual General Conference of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on Oct. 5, 2024.</p>
        <h2>Elder Gong’s talk summary</h2>
        <p>“Ours is a gospel of joy and holiness in everyday life.” Holiness invites all to infuse daily living with the  sacred.</p>
        <p>Church members’ stories of everyday holiness are inspiring. “You live seven C’s: communion with God, community and compassion with each other, commitment and covenant with God, family and friends — centered in Jesus Christ.”</p>
        <p>Examples of these stories include a recently married couple “sharing with authenticity and vulnerability  gospel covenants, sacrifice and service in their unfolding lives.”</p>
        <p>A sister, yearning for a better relationship with her father, felt impressed to take him to the temple with  her. This began regular daddy-daughter trips to the temple. “Spending time in the house of the Lord has  healed us,” she said.</p>
        <p>Jean Gong, Elder Gong’s mother, died earlier this year. The decision to be baptized and join the Church at 15 years old is one that most shaped her life. “My mother had covenant faith and trust in the Lord that blessed her life and all our family generations.”</p>
        <p>Everyday holiness to the Lord “includes coming more often to the Lord in His holy house.” Doing so “prepares us to live with God our Father, a Man of Holiness, Jesus Christ and our loved ones.”</p>
